# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern-TASK-2 Repository

Welcome to the Brainwave_Matrix_Intern-TASK-2 repository!

This repository showcases code developed by [@hrishi439](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hrishikesh-mallela-0a39112ab) during an internship at Brainwave Matrix Solutions. It includes tasks assigned as part of the internship program, demonstrating skills in Python programming.

## 📦 Inventory Management System

This is a simple Inventory Management System built using Python and SQLite. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter to manage products, track inventory levels, and perform basic inventory operations.
